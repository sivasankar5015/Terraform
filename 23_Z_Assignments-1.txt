Building a CI/CD Pipeline Using Terraform:

Go to http://:8080 and complete the Jenkins setup. From the command line of the Jenkins server, run the following command to get the password:

sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
Install the default plugins.
Create a Jenkins user account.

Create a Pipeline to deploy for a Docker Service
Click New Item and select Pipeline.
Name the project MyDeployment.
Ensure that the project is parameterized.
Create two choice parameters: image_name and ghost_ext_port.
The choices for image_name should be set to ghost:latest and ghost:alpine.
The choices for ghost_ext_port should be set to 80 and 8081.

The Pipeline
The pipeline should clone the following Git repository:
https://github.com/satyensingh/terraform-docker-service.git


Running the Terraform commands requires supplying the path to the binary: /usr/local/bin/terraform.
Create a three stage pipeline: init, plan, and apply.
For the init stage, use a shell script sh to initialize Terraform. Set the label to Initialize Terraform.

For the plan stage, use a shell script sh to generate a Terraform plan. Set the label to Plan Terraform.
The Terraform plan should do the following:

Create a plan file called deploy_service to be used with the apply.
Ensure that the plan is not prompted for inputs.
Pass in the variables image_name and ghost_ext_port and set them to their corresponding parameters.
Using a script, create a timeout and input.
The timeout should be for 10 minutes.
The input should have an id of Deploy Gate, a message that states Deploy environment? and ok of Deploy.

For the apply stage, use a shell script sh to execute terraform apply.
Set the label to Deploy Infrastructure. The terraform apply should do the following:

Set locking to false.
Ensure that the apply is not prompted for inputs.
Use the deploy_service plan file created during the plan stage.
Test the job
From MyDeployment click Build with Parameters.
Select ghost:alpine for the image_name and 8081 for ghost_ext_port.
Click the Build button. In the Build History click on the job number.
Then click on Console Output.
The job will be paused and you need to either click on Deploy or Abort.
Click Deploy so that the job can resume.
Visit: http://[PUBLIC_IP]:8081 to see if Ghost blog pulls up.

- Checking for available provider plugins on https://releases.hashicorp.com...
- Downloading plugin for provider "docker" (2.6.0)...

The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,
so the latest version was installed.

To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
changes, it is recommended to add version = "..." constraints to the
corresponding provider blocks in configuration, with the constraint strings
suggested below.

* provider.docker: version = "~> 2.6"

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.[0m
